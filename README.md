# ESP_Lightcontroller
This is a ESP2866-based PCB to controll up to 4 channels of LEDs with up to 10A per channel.

This was designed in EasyEDA and I have included the easyeda save files and also a generic gerber archive.

The ESP2866 can be flashed by the 4 pins to the right of it with a usb-serial converter on 3.3V.

Below I have attached some images of the schematic and the board, as well as the finished PCB that I have ordered from jlcpcb
